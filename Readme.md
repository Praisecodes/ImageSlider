# Image Slider

This is an Image Slider web project crearted by me to help me learn JavaScript a little better <br/>

In as much as I'm new to JavaScript, I'm not new to programming which means that I have been in this field long enough
to understand that you only get better at something if you're able to practice more and more, so I'll be having a lot of 
JavaScript codes on my GitHub page now.

``` js
console.log("More Of JavaScript coming at you");
```
